# Overengineered dog app

Created using **ReasonML/ReScript** when there is no **reason** to do so (pun intended).

## How to run it in development server?

1. Install all dependencies `using yarn` or `npm install`
2. You must run `yarn re:watch` to compile ReScript first
3. Then run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
4. The development server should start now.


## Future plans
s
Currently, I have no plan for this project as it started as procastination.
But you can add feature or fix bug if you like it. Please send any PR you wished.
